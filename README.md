## ⚡ **How the Application Works**

1. The page has **three input fields** for:

   * Celsius
   * Fahrenheit
   * Kelvin

2. When a user types a value in any of the fields:

   * Corresponding temperatures in the other two units are calculated immediately
   * The converted values are displayed in their respective fields
   * Values are rounded to two decimal places for neat output

3. Event listeners are attached to all three inputs to handle real-time conversion without needing a submit button.

## 💡 **Possible Future Enhancements**

* Improve UI with more styling or animations
* Add reset/clear buttons
* Include explanations of conversion formulas for educational use
* Dark/light mode toggle

## 📥 **Setup Instructions**

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Enter values in any field to see real-time conversions
